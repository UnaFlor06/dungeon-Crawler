//Undercity:

/ The ruins of New Alexandria, perhaps the largest underground network of settlemets before the Entanglement. When the day came, humanity sought to hide itself from the horrors above, but did not think of the horrors within. Not even the air enters the rubble of the forgotten...

//Abovesettle:

/ The Undercity is valuable, but diffcult and expensive to reach, governments thought fit to hire looters and crawlers to explore and claim the place. This place wasn't built with care and hope, but with envy and greed to harbor the vile.

//Frontier:

/ A bittersweet land of purple beauty and existential dread, once home to diverse sites built by its original settlers. The wind howls and creeks with the souls of those who came before and those who will come, as this was ground zero for the Entanglement.

//Children of Gaia:

/ Believed to be descendats of the first humans to settle the Frontier, they consider themselves to be the only sapient species to have right to this land. Their society breeds conflict, unnacepting of the life brought by the Entanglement, worshippers of their own artifice, it is best to stray far from them.

//Xulu A'thoi

/ A sapient species of Octopus like beings, they were brought on to this world by the Entanglement. Smart, cunning, but also fragile, these beings manipulate dark energy and matter much like humans once manipulated the fundamental physical energies. Generally defensive and wary, but will be friendly and receptive by those deemable as allies.
